\mainpage MSTK: The Mass Spectrometry ToolKit

\section intro Introduction
MSTK is a collection of libraries for (mostly proteomics) mass spectrometry data
processing.

Software development in mass spectrometry/proteomics data processing requires
substantial resources. Although a diverse set of tools have been developed
addressing various specific data processing problems, there are still only very
few libraries that provide generic, reusable MS code components that are
necessary for productive software development.

MSTK follows the idea that underlies the boost C++ libraries: we provide an
open, tried and tested, high-quality, fully configurable, (close to)
zero-dependency set of libraries. This speeds initial development, results in
fewer bugs, reduces reinvention-of-the-wheel, and cuts long-term software
development and maintenance costs. MSTK emphasizes on generic programming
methods, makes use of templated interfaces, accessor functions and enable
(partial) template specializations by the user. MSTK is developed using a
cross-platform build environment, contains an extensive test suite and code
coverage analysis, and comes with documentation and examples. MSTK is licensed
under an MIT license 
and is freely
available for academic and commercial use.
(with the exception of the MSTK/ngq component)
